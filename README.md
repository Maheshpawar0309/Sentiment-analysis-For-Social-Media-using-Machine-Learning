# ***Sentiment Analysis for Social Media***
## ***Twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-Python-Machine-Learning***

* The project aims to develop a Python tool for analyzing sentiments towards Pfizer vaccines on Twitter.
*  Data sourced from Kaggle includes tweets specifically related to Pfizer vaccines.

*   Analysis of these tweets will categorize them as expressing positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
*  Machine learning techniques will be applied to train the program to accurately recognize and classify sentiments.

*   Various machine learning algorithms will be tested to determine the most effective for sentiment analysis.
*   Ultimately, the project seeks to gain insights into the prevailing sentiments among Twitter users regarding Pfizer vaccines.


      # Data Preprocessing:


*   Cleaning the text data by converting it to lowercase, removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and non-alphanumeric characters.
*   Tokenizing the text into individual words and removing stopwords to prepare it for analysis.


# Sentiment Analysis:

*   Calculating sentiment polarity using TextBlob to determine whether a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
*  Visualizing sentiment distribution using count plots and pie charts to understand the overall sentiment trends in the dataset.



# Feature Engineering:

*   Converting the preprocessed text data into numerical features using CountVectorizer, which transforms text data into a matrix of token counts.
*  Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.


# Model Training :

*  Training machine learning models
  1. Logistic Regression model
  2. Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) model
  3.   Multinomial Naive Bayes model
*  Evaluating the performance of each trained model on the testing dataset using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.bold text



# Model Evaluation :

*   Assessing the performance of each trained model by comparing its predictions to the actual sentiment labels in the testing dataset.
*  Calculating accuracy scores to measure the proportion of correctly classified samples by each model.
